# I designed an application for members of a neighborhood community to request chores or tasks they may need help accomplishing. It is an organized way to keep track and record all tasks related to home care. The application uses complex abstract data types like ArrayLists, Sets, Maps, and Linkedlists to store and pass data, and an online database, provided by Google Realtime Database, is used to update all users.
